<p>On my mother's side, going back on her mother's side was indigenous Australian.</p>
<p>My mother doesn't know which mob or tribe she belongs too.</p>
<p>This isn't a result of stolen generation, but the fact that my grandmother,</p>
<p>great grandmother and great great grandmother and so on passed them selves off as Indian or Spanish</p>
<p>or similar so that the children would not be taken.  This led to no one knowing what tribe or mob they came from.</p>

<p>Before that they came from England, Wales, European.  Now my family is spread all over the world.</p>

<h3 id="C1">PROJECT</h3>


<h6>OVERVIEW</h6>
<p></p>
<p>The aim of this project is to aid with communications.  My suite of apps would be called CommunicateMe .</p>
<p>CommicateMe would aid people with communications.  It would provide the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Voice recording with the ability to playback.</li>
	<li>Voice to text.  With the ability for a person speaking be translated into a text document</li>
	<li>Text to speech -  the ability to type text and have that read out.  Ideally different voices, ie:male female would be an option.</li>
	<li>CommicateMe symbols to voice</li>
	<li>Ability to use CommicateMe visual symbols to aid someones ability to understand.</li>
	<li>Ability to have captions on videos *closed captions)</li>
	<li>Translate voices from different languages </li>
	<li>Future ability to connect with telephone systems to have text appear on a screen connected to the telephone system.  The user could also type text and have it read back over the phone.  It could auto answer the phone so that the caller know they are speaking to a facilitated device.  The end user could also make calls using this system.</li>
	<li>The aid would be available on PC’s, Android. Tablets, iPhone, iPad, mac and communication devices.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<h6>MOTIVATION</h6>
<p></p>

<p>Every day people struggle with language being heard, been understood, understanding what is said.  It is often a complete nightmare for those people with these issues,

Its so difficult because these issues potentially and in real life lead to isolation, frustration for them, their family and friends.  Also many of these people find themselves excluded from the workforce, everyday situations, the ability to participate and join in the commodity.

Things should not be this way and don’t have to be this way.  I feel with all of our knowledge and advances in technology there should be a solution.

Upon instigation I have found partial solutions, but nothing that really fixes the problems

That is why I have come up with CommunicateMe as my project is to work towards finding better solutions. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<center-left>
<h5 style="color:Navy;">DESCRIPTION</h5>
<p></p>
<p style="color:MediumVioletRed;">The suite of apps would facilitate communications for the client or end user.  The end user would have the ability via a drop down menu or installed functions to show what service was required.
This means that  a end user might not use all features if not required.</p>

<p style="color:MediumVioletRed;">The product will feature a big icon with the words CommunicateMe  with its own logo.  It will also come with read.me files for installers ad about information for the end user. </p>

<p style="color:MediumVioletRed;">Then the next screen will have a number of icons on the screen with options on the icons such as record, text to speech, speech to text.  Also there would be symbols like compic that could be pressed to either let the end user express a need such as need toilet, or it allows any carer or teacher or aide to ask if the end user requires the toilet.</p> 

<p style="color:MediumVioletRed;">These icons would have options under them, such as the record feature will also have a playback option, a function to convert it to text.    The speech or voice to text option would link the end user directly into speech being turned to text, like dictation software.    The text to voice or speech option would allow the end user to type any requirements or what they want communicated and have that read out in a choice of voices.  the icons would flow and lead to several sub menus under the icons.

The symbol function could be used with the other functions or with a special communications tablet.  The symbols could be things like toilet, sit, listen, reading time and so on.  The end user could press these symbols or the carer or aide could touch to have it read out and illuminated for the end user as a requirement for them to follow.  This would also let them type any words they were able to.

As a side note I would also build a web site to promote the product and describe its functions.
The app would have multiple actions and have a menu  to choose the type of action you want.</p>
